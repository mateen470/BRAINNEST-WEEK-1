      <h2>
        It is important to do bodybuilding, beacuse it just unlocks a different
        you. Obviously it is great for your muscles but it is also beneficial
        for you heart and mind. I have been engaged with gym for about a year
        now and I can clearly see the imporvement in me, both physcially and
        mentally.
