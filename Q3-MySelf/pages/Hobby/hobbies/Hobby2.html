        costumes, sound design, architecture, theatre, and other elements of
        movies, are all part of the art. Many painters, designers, sculptors,
        musicians, and other artists work together to create a combination of
        all these arts, which is called a movie. Watching movies help us
        appreciate art and often make us interested in some kind of art or
